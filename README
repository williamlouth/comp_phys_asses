all the results for the assessment can be reproduced by running the run_me.py file using python3. 
The tasks can also be run seperately by running their respective files individually. 
1. floating_point_test.py 2. LU_decomp.py 3. interpolation.py 4. fft.py 5. random_numb.py

For each of the files there is also a test script which ensures that all the function operate as expected.
These test scripts are called test_file.py . Where file is replaced with one of the names above.

  
The project is coded using python3 and makes extensive use of numpy arrays and list comprehensions.
Many sections of the tasks are in a single list comprehension.
Each python file contains an asses function which calls the requisite functions to execute the assessment
tasks and to produce graphs of the results. 
The larger functions in LU decomposition and interpolation have some input validation checking as these are most likely
to give strange behaviour with erroneous inputs.
